another dynavision


- overall epoch 5 looks best as the cape collar is more accurate compared to 3
- eye color is almost always off. might have to do with the "finely detailed beautiful eyes" in the prompt
	- prompting without that the quality of the eyes sucks so its a trade off and 
	- has todo with the dynavision model as the "finely detailed beautiful eyes" was copied from the bluepencil prompt where it didnt impact color
- on most seeds eyes still look bad
- realized that the fracolor was the reason. creating another grid	


--> 000005 wins
