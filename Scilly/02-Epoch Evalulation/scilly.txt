trail of thought for the epoch evaluation across multiple models

- at 0.8 weight the shoes look "sneaker slike" across the board
	- makes sense tho as we want to primarily have good result at 1 weight
- epoch 00001 looks off: 
	- arm has wrong color, overknees become transparent
	- at 1.1 the entire arm is robotic
	- skirt looks wrong
	- makes sense, not trained enough
- Eyes look off at weight 1 from epochs 00001 to 00003 --- epoch 00004 still a bit weird, epoch 00005 is great
- Eyes look overtrained at weight 1 from 00006 onwards


----- best result 00005 -> 2nd best? THERE IS NO SECOND BEST ---> ehehe no its prolly 00004 -> lets strip 00001, 00002 and 00009 moving forward

- from 000006 across at weight 1, scilly looks overtrained,  the face/eyes are a clear indicator.
- lets strip 00007 + 00008 this round but still keep 00006 as it becomes clearer that scilly looks great with less steps trained already
- we will also stop to look at weight 0.8 to speed up the grid generation

----- best result imho is 00004 at weight 1



################

lets continue with the dynavisionXLAll model

scilly standing on cliff
- this example generation includes highres fix via latent upscaler
- all of these look fantastic. its hard to make a decision
- we cut out 00006 and prompt as the lower epochs look very similar
- we prompt again on a different seed without highres fix as we see two robotic arms across the board 
- the second grid carries over the problem with the 2 robotic arms but imho we should ignore this for now and don't cut anything out
- looking back after prompting bluepencil-XL I realized that the robotic arm always has a human hand across the board in the first grid
- this is not the case anymore in the second grid so it seems to accur random according to seed

------ 00005 at weight 1 looks most consistent

###############

Next up Bluepencil-XL
-> prompt base via https://civitai.com/images/3583304

- we stumble into the problem again that Scilly always has 2 robotic arms no matter which
- we bring 00006 and 00007 back into the grid to see what happens. turns out that 6 is fine and at 7 the double robot arm appears again
- overall the results look incredibly good. bluepencil v1 has a great training dataset and they've iterated a lot - one of the best anime models out there
- we will strip out 00007 again tho as the eyes look weird across all weights
- we create a new grid from 00003 to 00006 at weight 1 but prompt different seeds on the y axis to dig into the two robotic arms situation
	- when we prompt with SD not everything is perfect so usually you prompt a batch of 4 or 8 or whatever images with different seed and select the best one
	- in the end we need to select one LoRA file that is not overtrained as it should be able to work with a variety of models. also we can adjust weight as we prompt
- the multiple seed grid shows us that higher epochs show less random issues with the hands. I'd prefer 000005 and 000006 over the lower 2 epochs. 
- legs are broken at epoch 00004 2 out of 5 times
- We remove 000003 as it never won any prompt till this point. 



------ 000006 at weight 1 (seed 13337) turned out to be most beautiful

##############

A last prompt done with Bluepencil-XL
-> based on the last one

- epoch 4 at weight 1 results in two robot arms most of the time. we'll strip that out
- epoch 5 and 6 both look very good

----- 000005 at weight 1 (seed 1338) looks best tho -- several 000006 images are close

Next up SDXL Yamer's Anime

- besides the occasional double robot arms across all epochs all epochs look amazing
- the legs on epoch 6 are buggy multiple times tho
- to evaluate the arms issue a bit further on this model and as it gets cleared that we will need to decide between epoch 5+6 I generate a grid of 16 images each via seed -1
	- epoch 5: 12 robot, 1 invis, 3 correct
	- epoch 6: 5 robot, 1 invis, 10 correct
- aside from the robot arms it is really hard to make a decision

----- 000006 both win here 


#############

We go back to Dynavision
-> prompt base via https://civitai.com/images/3740620

- for epoch 4 we see lots of robot arms
- both epoch 5 und 6 are very consistent when it comes to the arms
- 


#############

we choose epoch 6 as the final LoRA which in the end was trainer with 6000 training steps
- after looking back across all grids to check how epoch 6 compares to 5 as I nominated them as a winners it becomes clear that 6 was very close anyways
- the issue with the 2 robot arms could become a problem with different models and tbh I dont see any major reason why we shouldn't go for epoch 6 over 5 having that in mind.
